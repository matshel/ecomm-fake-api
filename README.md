In this project I have recreated Christian Mihai's e-commerce website.
The purpose of making this project was to learn about React, and enhance my React skills.
I also got to code some additions to this project that I have learned from doing other projects.

For the product information I used fakestore's API - [fakestoreapi](https://fakestoreapi.com/) 

## Additions

- Added Animate on scroll on selected elements, which i learned from doing [landing](https://github.com/matshel/landing) project.
- Added missing cart item amount.
- Altered some css so product details page would not be squeezed in container on mobile.

## Built with

- Create React App (CRA) [cra](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- Tailwind [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- React Icons [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
